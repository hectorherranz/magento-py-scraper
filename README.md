# magento-py-scraper
(Under construction) A python scraper for magento

## Description

This script has been carried out under the context of the Subject _Tipology and life cycle of data_, belonging to the Master's Degree in Data Science of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. In it, scraping _web techniques are applied_ through the Python programming language to extract data from some web and generate a _dataset_.

## Context

This script performs crawling using the BFS or DFS algorithms and extracts a list of **products** of a magento website that you provided.

## Content

The content of the resulting _dataset_ is one row per product including the host, product name , product price, category, image url and url to the product.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [debugtalk](https://github.com/debugtalk/WebCrawler), I used his well-implemented web crawler as a base to apply scraping techniques. I did not have time in addition to applying the scraping techniques, build a good crawler that used the BFS and DFS algorithms. 


## Inspiration

A colleague from when I studied engineering told me that in his work they were using an online service to scraping about Magento ecommerce products. Then I said: I make you one, for free!

The MIT license is a great choice because it allows you to share your code under a copyleft license without forcing others to expose their proprietary code, it’s business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization. Here’s why I use the MIT license and what it’s all about.

## Team

The activity has been done individually by **Me**.
